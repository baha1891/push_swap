# Push_swap

## Description
The **push_swap** project is a very simple and highly effective algorithm project: data must be sorted. You have at your disposal a set of integer values, 2 stacks, and a set of instructions to manipulate both stacks.

The goal is to write a program in C called `push_swap` which calculates and displays the shortest sequence of instructions to sort the integer arguments received.

## Instructions

### Compilation
To compile the mandatory part, run:
```bash
make
